## Hello World

The easiest way to get started with `senaite.publisher` is to copy a template in
the `templates/reports` folder within this package.


The smallest report example looks like this:

```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

It renders a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the report.

<img src="static/1_hello_world.png" alt="Hello World" />

The next few sections will gradually introduce you to using `senaite.publisher`.
We will examine single- and multi reports, Zope page templates and the report model.
Once you master them, you can create complex reports for SENAITE.
